# dotnet-student-mvc-windows
.NET Core MVC Application. similar to https://github.com/alhoqbani/dotnet-students-mvc but made on Windows.

I made this application to learn ASP.NET Core MVC following [Lynda Course](https://www.lynda.com/ASP-NET-tutorials/Learn-ASP-NET-Core-MVC-Basics/512728-2.html)

The course rebuilt CaliforniaExplorer static website using .NET. However, I built diffirent site using Students domain.
